### Project Overview
This project analyzes a subset of the Divvy bike-sharing dataset to identify trends, user behaviors, and potential insights for business decision-making.

### Dataset Information
The data for this project was sourced from Divvy Bike Data. Unfortunately, due to file size limitations, the dataset itself is not included in this repository. You can obtain the full dataset from Divvy's official website or your course provider.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **View the Cyclistic Case Study Output**  
   To see the project output, click the following link to view the HTML page generated from the R Markdown file:

   [View Cyclistic Case Study Output (HTML)](cyclistic_case_study.html)

2. **Review the R Markdown Code**  
   To review the code behind the analysis, you can click the `.Rmd` file in this repository:  
   - `cyclistic_case_study.Rmd`

   The `.Rmd` file contains the analysis steps and visualizations. You can run the file in RStudio or any R environment.

3. **Data Setup (Manual Download Required)**  
   As the dataset cannot be directly included in this repository, you'll need to download the Divvy bike-sharing data from the source.  
   Once you have the data, place the CSV files in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file to run the analysis correctly. You can find links to the dataset on the course provider's site or Divvy's official data resources page.

4. **Running the Analysis**  
   After you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the same directory, open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio or your preferred R environment, and knit the document to generate the output.

   If necessary, adjust the file paths in the code to point to the location of your CSV files.

## Project Files

- `cyclistic_case_study.Rmd`: This file contains the code for the analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file explains the project structure, dataset details, and instructions for running the project.

### Additional Notes
- Make sure that the CSV files are in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file for proper data access.
- If you encounter any issues with file paths, adjust them as necessary in the R code.
